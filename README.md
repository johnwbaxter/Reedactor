Reedactor
=========

An ExpressionEngine fieldtype for Redactor, a "Fantastic WYSIWYG-editor on jQuery". See http://redactorjs.com for more info on the jQuery plug-in. 

So far, this is a very simple implementation. There are no settings controls in the EE control panel for the fieldstype. To tweak settings, edit the reedactor.js file in the theme folder. Here are the options http://redactorjs.com/docs/settings.

To do
-----
Add some control panel settings for finer control of the plug-in options.
Maybe integrate with EE file manager... if possible.
